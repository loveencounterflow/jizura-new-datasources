I've been wondering about this for years and have no clear-cut answer, but I have a suspicion that this is a case where the caoshu habits of writers propagated into their less cursive styles and ended up becoming the standard for all styles.

To see what I mean have a look at these samples of 通 written in different styles:

* zhuanshu: https://sf.zdic.net/sf/zs/0127/fa852c26fd6c8916ff96483d62752cf5.html

* lishu: https://sf.zdic.net/sf/ls/0127/fa852c26fd6c8916ff96483d62752cf5.html

* kaishu: https://sf.zdic.net/sf/ks/0127/fa852c26fd6c8916ff96483d62752cf5.html

* xingshu: https://sf.zdic.net/sf/xs/0127/fa852c26fd6c8916ff96483d62752cf5.html

* caoshu: https://sf.zdic.net/sf/cs/0127/fa852c26fd6c8916ff96483d62752cf5.html

One can immediately see that the 'blockier' the writing style, the more likely it is to see 通 being written in a left-to-right manner; in some zhuanshu and lishu samples the structure of 通 is really left-to-right like it is in 𢓶:⿰彳甬 (in fact a variant of 通), not as 通:⿺辶甬. And although the progression of writing styles chosen here does not match the historical development (where of course we see cursive styles being in wide use centuries before kaishu came about), the zhuanshu form ⿰⿱彳止甬 really points to the origin of 辶, still visible today in its 'quotation form', 辵.

Conversely, when we move to 'curvier' styles toward caoshu, we see an increasingly tendency and likelihood the artist chose to realize as 辶 with a thick stroke below or even only as a stroke below the rest of the character, as if it were 恿 but without the dots, ⿱甬㇃. This I can hardly imagine to have been written in anything than first 甬, followed by ㇃, whereas the zhuanshu sequence should have been the other way round: first 彳, then 止, then 甬.

Because xingshu and caoshu is what people predominantly use in their daily lives, be it a letter to a friend or a shopping list, stroke orders like ⿱甬㇃ is what people actually use most of the time. When the occasion calls for a clearer, less cursive script then you don't have to change your habits when you just start the lower part with two dots, so instead of ⿱甬㇃, you write (⿱甬⺀㇃) and you're done. This is not unlike people do it in any Latin-based writing system.

In the case of characters with 辶 (and, incidentally, with 廴 as in 延 for which cf https://sf.zdic.net/sf/cs/0508/608423ef62ba43c5342fb2b1b274cfcd.html), apparently the xingshu and caoshu forms are what won out the competition for the most common strokeorder, and as we have seen, there was in fact a competing way of writing. Let me add that of course the entire appearance of 辶 in kaishu is a back-formation of a cursive style when writing out ⿱彳止 was already deemed too much trouble, maybe too archaic. 

To show this is not entirely a made-up story of my own, let me add that there are a few occasions where historical accident meant that ⿱彳止 was not reduced to 辶: this includes variants of 徒 which include 𢓂𢔗𣥲𧺑𧺔𨑒𨑡, all of them plausible candidates for a modern standard form, all of them displaying to various degrees what in Japanese is aptly called 崩し書き (くずしがき) "collapsed / dilapidated / handwritten characters", namely the breakdown of intentional distinct components to mere squiggles, fused and molten.

Lastly, we have characters like 女 and 玉. Judging from its present kaishu form, 女 should be written 一𡿨㇒; the reason that the common strokeorder is 𡿨㇒一 seems to be lying in the fact that older forms hat the 𡿨㇒ touching at the top, something that is still visible in its cursive form, preserved in the hiragana め. The appearance of 女 evolved but the habitual hand movement "め" did not. As for 玉, its kaishu strokeorder is 一一丨一丶 which follows the rules (all horizontals before the crossing vertical). However, the Japanese standard has it as 一丨一一丶, which not incidentally reflects exactly what you do in Chinese outside of trying to appease your kaishu calligraphy teacher (cf https://sf.zdic.net/sf/xs/1021/82a47240df8c2e37d3f6356bbe387c4a.html); 玉 effectively has two standard strokeorders, one for the standards book and the careful kaishu writing, the other for the rest of your life.
